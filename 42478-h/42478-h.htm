<h2 class="sb">TALL TALES OF SPORT AND ADVENTURE.</h2>
<p class="center1">(<em>By Mr. Punch's own Short Story-teller.</em>)</p>
<p class="title1b"><span class="sc">Introduction.</span></p>

<p>Not many living men, and even fewer in the ages that are past,
have&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;sported with greater assiduity and
success than I have during a life which is even now little past its
middle period. At one time on horseback, at another on the bounding
and impulsive elephant; now bestriding the matchless dromedary
on his native prairie, now posted on foot in a jungle crowded with
golden pheasants in all the native splendour of their plumage; sometimes
matching my solitary craft against a host of foxes on the swelling
uplands of Leicestershire, sometimes facing the Calydonian boar or
the sanguinary panther in their woodland lairs, dealing showers of
leaden death from a hundred tubes, or tracking my fearful prey by
the lonely light of a wax vesta and
despatching it at midnight with
my trusty bowie&mdash;wherever there
were leagues to be walked, risks to
be run, or fastnesses to be rushed
there not only have I been the first,
but (paradoxical as it may appear)
there also have I succeeded and
have never been successfully followed.
My experiences are therefore
unique, and it is in the hope
that they may to some extent profit
a younger generation, less inured,
I fear, to hardship and danger than
my own, that I now set pen to
paper and recount some of the
exploits that have made my name
famous wherever sport is loved
and true sportsmen are revered.</p>

<p>A less modest man might have
said more, but one whose deeds
speak for him in every quarter of
the world may well be content to
leave to punier men the ridiculous
trumpeting braggadocio that too
often makes so-called sportsmen
the laughing stock of society. For
myself, I can never forget the
lesson I learned at an early age
from my dear father, himself a
shikari of no common order, though
to be sure, as he himself would be
the first to admit if he were alive,
the exploits of the son (I had no
brothers) have now thrust the
parental performances into the
background. Still, it was my
father who first inculcated upon
my infant mind the daring, the
ignorance of fear, the contempt of
danger, and the iron endurance
which have since made me a household
word. Heaven rest the old
man! He sleeps his last sleep far away in the Desert of Golden
Sand, with no head-stone to mark his resting-place, and neither
the roaring of his old enemies the tigers, nor the bellowing of the
countless alligators who infest the spot can rouse him any more.
Alas! it was trustfulness that destroyed him. He was gored to
death by a favourite rhinoceros that he had rescued at a tender age
when its mother was killed, and had brought up to know and, as he
thought, to love him. But I have always thought myself that the
rhinoceros was a treacherous brute, and though I have often been
asked to tame one, for presentation to this or that Emperor, I have
consistently declined.</p>

<p>Marvellous, however, as my father was in his day for his exploits
and his variegated bags of game, he was perhaps even more wonderful
for the unswerving accuracy with which he was accustomed to
relate his adventures. Far and wide over the steppes of Central
Asia, the burning regions of equatorial Africa, the precipitous
haunts of the American Grizzly, and the wild retreats of the
ferocious Albanian pig&mdash;everywhere, in short, where he had set
foot or drawn trigger, this peculiarity of his was known and appreciated,
and many a respectful <em>sobriquet</em> did it earn for him from the
savage tribes amongst whom he spent the best years of his life. In
Kashmir he was known as <em>Peili Ton</em>, that is, the man who cannot lie;
amongst the swarthy Zambesians the name of <em>Govun Bettîr</em> (the Undefeated
and Veracious Man) was a name to conjure with even when
in their moments of warlike passion the tribesmen rushed madly
through their primeval thickets, shouting their terrible war-cry,
"<em>Itzup ures Leeve</em>," that is, "Death to the white-faced robbers."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;"><a href="images/013-900.png"><img src="images/013-360.png" width="360" height="481" alt="'He had indeed seen ten bocks.'" /></a>
<h4>"He had indeed seen ten bocks."</h4></div>

<p>But what I wished specially to relate about my poor father was
the lesson of truthfulness which he inculcated upon me at an early
age. He and I (I was then but a lad of twelve) had been hunting
the ferocious Pilsener gemsbock through the wild Lagerland in which
he makes his home. It happened one morning that we had parted
company. To me was assigned the duty of beating through the
Bier-Wald, the dense forest which stretches mile upon mile in unbroken
gloom to the confines of the Boose-See. The Fates were
propitious. Wherever I turned I saw a victim, and one after
another I brought down with unerring aim twenty-four (as I
thought) of these noble animals, whose horns are now worth a king's
ransom, and might, even in those distant days, have rescued a
minor German Prince from captivity. Hastening home with my
booty loaded upon my back&mdash;I was a strong boy for my age, but of
course nothing to what I have since become&mdash;I met my dear father
just as I reached the door of the hut which served us for hunting
quarters. Joyously I cast down my
burden, and sprang to his side. But
my father wore an expression of
annoyance, and I soon discovered
that the luck had been against him.
He had indeed seen ten bocks, but
for some reason his aim had lacked
its accustomed deadliness, and he
had come back empty-handed. I
condoled with him in a boy's artless
fashion, and proceeded to tell
him how fortunate I had been.</p>

<p>"How many have you shot?"
he asked me.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four," was my reply.</p>

<p>"Count them," said my father.</p>

<p>I did so, and you may judge of
my astonishment when I found
that twenty-six had fallen to my
gun. I counted again and again.
Yes, there were twenty-six of them.
With one of my shots I must have
brought down three. In the agitation
of the moment I had overlooked
this. I told my father that
I had made a slight mistake, and
endeavoured to explain how it had
arisen. But my father was inexorable.</p>

<p>"A lie," he said, "is a lie. You
said you had shot twenty-four, you
have actually killed twenty-six.
You must suffer."</p>

<p>Over the rest of the painful
scene I draw a veil. The shrieks
of my mother, who implored
pardon for me on her bended
knees, still seem to ring in my
ears. Since that time I have always
respected not only the strict
truth, but also the leather thongs
which are in use in the Lagerland
for the droves of untameable cattle
that roam the prairies. This was my lesson, and I have never,
never forgotten it.</p>

<h3>TO AN OLD FLAME.&mdash;(<span class="sc">Twenty Years after.</span>)</h3>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Something to Live for.</span>&mdash;The <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> announced last
Friday that "a bevy of head-masters will appear in the pulpit of St.
Paul's this month." How many go to a "bevy" we are not aware,
though perhaps we might ascertain it from Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>, who
could inform us, after several crowded houses, how many go to see
the "bevy," and how many combine to make up a "bevy," of ballet
beauties in the pantomime; but putting it say at a dozen, the bevy
of head-masters in their caps and gowns would find the pulpit of St.
Paul's rather a tight fit. Pretty sight though, anyway.</p>

<h2>THE NEW YEAR'S DAY DREAM.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
<em>A Tennysonian Fragment from the Popular
Pantomime of "Harlequin Harcourt, the
Sleeping Beauty, and the Financial Fairy
Prince."</em>
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
["The Revenue Returns," says the <em>Daily News</em>,
"for the expired three quarters of the financial
year show that a sum of close upon £62,000,000
has been paid into the Exchequer. The <span class="sc">Chancellor
of the Exchequer's</span> estimated revenue
for the whole year was a little over £94,000,000.
This is regarded as an indication of the revival of
trade, and the promise of a substantial surplus for
the next Budget."]
</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="sc">The Arrival.</span></h3>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>All blessèd boons, though coming late,</p>
<p class="i2">To those who wait them issue forth,</p>
<p>For skill in sequel works with fate,</p>

<p>He comes, great keeper of our tin,</p>
<p class="i2">He is no Tory <em>Hurlo-Thrumbo!</em></p>
<p>A fairy Prince, with triple chin,</p>
<p class="i2">And heavy-footed as poor <em>Jumbo!</em></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He comes, scarce knowing what he seeks,</p>
<p class="i2">Though he has heard of Sleeping Beauties.</p>
<p>He hath been dreaming many weeks</p>
<p class="i2">Of Income Tax, Stamps, and Death Duties.</p>
<p>He'd charmed the party with his talk</p>
<p class="i2">Of Graduation; now grey fear</p>
<p>Knocks at his ribs, his cheek's like chalk,</p>
<p class="i2">With thoughts of Revenue for the Year.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>More close and close his footsteps wind,</p>
<p class="i2">The next year's Budget on his heart.</p>
<p>From Stamps and Liquor will he find</p>
<p class="i2">Big plums? Will rich taxpayers "part"?</p>
<p>Here's sleeping Trade! "Lor! what a lark!"</p>
<p class="i2">He thinks. "To wake her&mdash;were a spree!</p>
<p>A kiss <em>may</em> lift those lashes dark;</p>
<p class="i2">She can't resist a buss&mdash;from Me!"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<h3><span class="sc">The Revival.</span></h3>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A touch, a smack! A boxèd ear.</p>
<p class="i2">There came the sound of a smart slap.</p>
<p>The Fairy Prince, with cry of fear,</p>
<p class="i2">His hand unto his cheek did clap.</p>
<p>The Sleeping Beauty gave a gape,</p>
<p class="i2">A wide-mouthed yawn, a long-drawn stretch.</p>
<p><em>He</em> rubbed his chins. "This <em>is</em> a jape!</p>
<p class="i2">I <em>knew</em> my style the girl would fetch!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"In spite of all that <span class="sc">Wilson</span> says,<a id="footnotetag" name="footnotetag"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnote">*</a></p>
<p class="i2">I trust those Revenue Returns.</p>
<p>She <em>does</em> revive! Be mine the praise!</p>
<p class="i2">By Jove, though, how my left ear burns!</p>
<p>I told 'em that I'd do the trick</p>
<p class="i2">With my new fakement, the Death Duties.</p>
<p>Come, Miss, wake up! Revive, dear, quick!</p>
<p class="i2">You sleepiest of Sleeping Beauties!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>At last sweet slumbering Trade awoke,</p>
<p class="i2">And on her couch her form upreared.</p>
<p>The Prince smiled, rubbed his chins, and spoke.</p>
<p class="i2">"Ah, <span class="sc">Wilson's</span> prophecy is queered.</p>
<p>He swore that you would <em>not</em> revive,</p>
<p class="i2">In his Cassandra-like Review,</p>
<p>But don't sit yawning! Look alive!</p>
<p class="i2">Or men will swear I've humbugged you!"</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>"All right!" said sleepy Trade. "But still</p>
<p class="i2">My joints feel somewhat stiff or so.</p>
<p>Say, have you passed that Irish Bill</p>
<p class="i2">You schemed&mdash;<em>how</em> long was it ago?"</p>
<p>The Chancellor subdued a curse,</p>
<p class="i2">Which scarce would serve for a reply,</p>
<p>But dallied with his well-filled purse,</p>
<p class="i2">And smiling, put the question by.</p>

<h2 class="sb">THAT PRECIOUS DONKEY!</h2>
<p class="center1">(<em>An Episode in the Life of A. Briefless, Junior, Esq., Barrister-at-Law,
in Three Parts.</em>)</p>
<p class="title1b"><span class="sc">Part I.</span>&mdash;<em>The Coming into Possession of the Donkey.</em></p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said my excellent and admirable clerk, <span class="sc">Portington</span>,
"he came here three times, about a month ago. We thought he was
mad, so would not let him in. But the third time he left that
parcel and that letter. You see, Sir, they are tied together, and as
there was a bomb scare on at the time, we did not touch them.
That's how it comes, Sir, that you have not had them earlier."</p>

<p>I must confess I was a little annoyed. I frequently absent myself
from Pump-Handle Court for days and even weeks together, and then
I expect my clerical (I use the adjective in its non-ecclesiastical
sense) representative to forward my correspondence.</p>

<p>"It cannot be helped, <span class="sc">Portington</span>," I replied; "all I care for are
the interests of my clients. If the visitor was one anxious to lay his
case before me, I can only trust he has not suffered by my unpremeditated
absence."</p>

<p>"I do not think he will have to complain of that, Sir. And as to
his case, we don't know whether it is one; none of us like to touch
the parcel, lest it should go off."</p>

<p>"You mean with a report&mdash;it must get reported," I suggested,
with a smile. I allow myself a little frolicsome levity at Yuletide.
"Well, where is it?"</p>

<p>"In your room, Sir," and <span class="sc">Portington</span> led the way to my special
apartment.</p>

<p>I found my chamber tenanted by a miscellaneous collection of
articles. Truth to tell I do not use my rooms very frequently, and
consequently it has become a sort of a proverb amongst my co-parceners
in Pump-Handle Court, <em>à propos</em> of anything of a cumbersome
character, "When in doubt, put it into <span class="sc">Briefless's</span> cupboard."
Not that I really occupy a cupboard; my room (I lay the emphasis
on the word) is far more commodious than the largest specimen of
those receptacles. Consequently, I was not altogether surprised to
find collected together a banjo-case, some curtain rods, a number of
framed pictures, and a damaged bicycle. In the centre of the room
was an oblong parcel, to which was tied an envelope, doubtless containing
an enclosure.</p>

<p>With some slight trepidation&mdash;I had no wish to accompany Pump-Handle
Court to the skies&mdash;I opened the letter. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To <span class="sc">A. Briefless, Junior, Esq.</span>&mdash;Dear and Honoured Sir,&mdash;I have
long desired to show you some token of goodwill. I have frequently
read your contributions to the leading legal paper of the day (I refer,
of course, to the <em>London Charivari</em>), and have been filled with admiration
at the clearness of your style and the depth of your knowledge
of what may be termed the duplex action of the human heart. As I
happen to be Emperor of <span class="sc">China</span> I write anonymously. I have
been ruined by law and the lawyers. You have never represented
me or opposed me. For this I am very, very grateful, and beg you
to accept the accompanying present. It is a &mdash;&mdash; But hush, we are
observed."</p>

<p>And at this point the document abruptly terminated. I read the
letter to <span class="sc">Portington</span>, and asked his opinion upon it. He replied
abruptly he "considered the writer a lunatic."</p>

<p>"Well, no, I do not think we can go quite so far as that," I
observed. "You see, he seems to have some appreciation of my
talents. He may be a trifle eccentric, but I fancy nothing worse."</p>

<p>Encouraged by this belief in the sanity of my semi-anonymous (I
use the epithet advisedly, as I take it that the incidental claim to
the throne of the Celestial Empire was not urged seriously) correspondent,
I opened the package. The brown paper unwound and a
picture was revealed to us. It had evidently been painted for many
years. The frame (which, in <span class="sc">Portington's</span> opinion, was the best
portion of the structure) was distinctly old-fashioned. The gilding
was tarnished and the woodwork out of repair.</p>

<p>"What is the subject?" I asked, after three or four minutes' close
inspection.</p>

<p>"I think, Sir," replied my excellent and admirable clerk, "that
it's something to do with a donkey."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Portington</span> was right. On closer investigation the painting revealed
itself to be the representation of a cottage in the snow, with some villagers
drawing water from a half-frozen pond in the neighbourhood
of a rather intelligent donkey, who was watching their proceedings
with languid interest.</p>

<p>"Certainly it is a donkey," I exclaimed; "and, to my thinking, a
very fine one."</p>

<p>"What shall we do with it, Sir?" asked <span class="sc">Portington</span>. "It's no
good here; shall I give it to the dustman? He would take it away
if we asked him."</p>

<p>For a moment I thought my clerical (I use the adjective in its
non-ecclesiastical
sense) representative was indulging in jocularity. I
found I was in error. <span class="sc">Portington</span> was absolutely serious.</p>

<p>"You evidently do not know the value of some of these old frames.
Of course I shall take the picture with me to my private residence."</p>

<p>I carried out my intention. The canvas presentment of the donkey
and accessories was carefully conveyed in a four-wheeler to Justinian
Gardens, where I have rented for some years a very pleasant house.
The lady who has honoured me by taking my name, and whom in
my more playful humour I sportively term my "better seven-eighths,"
received me.</p>

<p>"I hope you have brought the music from the Stores," said the
lady, after our first greetings. "I suppose that package came from
Victoria Street?"</p>

<p>"No, my precious one," I replied; I sometimes use terms of endearment
to the members of my domestic circle. "It is a picture
given to me by a grateful client."</p>

<p>"Client!" she exclaimed; "and a grateful one! What a
find! But why bring it here? Haven't we already more pictures
than we want? Why at this moment there's half-a-dozen of extra
plates from the Christmas numbers that you <em>would</em> have framed,
waiting to be hung."</p>

<p>"But this, my love, is an oil-painting, with what I judge to be a
very valuable old-fashioned frame."</p>

<p>By this time my present was revealed.</p>

<p>"Why, it's only the picture of a donkey!" exclaimed my better
seven-eighths, with a laugh. "We really don't want that sort of
thing in the hall or reception rooms."</p>

<p>"But it is really very fine!" I urged. "Look at the handling
of that donkey's ears. And the frame, too, is simply magnificent."</p>

<p>"I don't so much mind the frame. We might take out the picture
and put in '<em>The Arrival of the Boulogne Boat</em>,' the Christmas
supplement to the <em>Young Lady's Boudoir</em>, in its stead. And yet it
is just as likely as not to spoil it. No, I think we had better put
picture and frame in the box-room."</p>

<p>"But my dear," I remonstrated; "this may be a very valuable
picture. The head of the donkey is quite remarkable and &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now do we want portraits of donkeys about the house? The boxroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
or the dust-hole is the proper place for
them."</p>

<p>"I know you objected to my own likeness&mdash;you
see the connection with the donkey,
dear?" I sometimes make rather humorous
remarks during the continuance of the festive
season.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly! But this hideous thing
should really go into the box-room." And so
it went. Perhaps on a future occasion I may
trace the further adventures of my grateful
client's gift. In my poor judgment they are
distinctly interesting and instructive.</p>

<blockquote><p>
[The Flint Town Council has censured the L. &amp;
N. W. Railway for dismissing some of its servants
for ignorance of the English language.]
</p></blockquote>

<p class="ind">Would you tell me, Porter, if the next
train is the one for Aberystwyth?</p>

<p class="ind">I am really very much obliged for your
reply, but as I have not a Cymric dictionary
at hand, I am totally unable even to guess at
your meaning.</p>

<p class="ind">As the man points to the train which is now
at the platform, and nods vigorously, I suppose
he means me to get in. Still, the fact
that it has "Llanrhychwyn" on it makes me
a little doubtful whether I shall ever reach
Aberystwyth if I enter it.</p>

<p class="ind">I am grateful for your attention, Guard,
but it was a foot-warmer that I asked for,
not the newspaper-boy.</p>

<p class="ind">As I have just been hurled down an embankment
and find myself sitting much bruised
in a shallow pond in a field close to the line, I
really fancy that the Welsh-speaking signalman
at the adjoining cabin has failed to
understand the message wired to him in
English from our last stopping station.</p>

<p class="ind">I should be glad, Stationmaster, if you would
kindly have a telegram sent to my friends
saying that I have only four ribs broken.</p>

<p class="ind">As you do not appear to understand what
I say, and as I suppose there is nobody who
knows English in this desolate Welsh valley
where the sufferers from the accident are
lying, perhaps you will kindly have us all
sent back to Shrewsbury as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="ind">The man lying next to me, whose arm is
hurt, says that the train was not going to
Aberystwyth at all. So perhaps it is as well
that circumstances have prevented my proceeding
further in it.</p>

<p class="ind">We should undoubtedly have been much
better off if this accident had happened to us
in France or Germany, because then we should
have been able to secure the services of the
railway interpreter.</p>

<p class="ind">Thank Heaven! I am back at Chester,
where the hotel people <em>do</em> talk English; and
in future I shall vote steadily at elections
against any party that does not make the
total suppression of all so-called "national
tongues" within the British Isles a part of
its recognised programme.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Rudolf Lehmann</span> possesses
some gifts which peculiarly
qualify him to write the volume
<span class="sc">Smith, Elder &amp; Co.</span> publish,
under the title <em>An Artist's Reminiscences</em>.
He has passed the age
of three-score and ten, and has
throughout that period had many
opportunities of seeing places, and,
more precious, of meeting people.
To the study of both he brings
keen sight, a good memory, and a
genuine, not too obtrusive, sense
of humour. Born in Hamburg in
1819, he has sojourned in most of
the capitals of Europe, permanently
settling down to marriage
and life in London. He seems to
have known most of the notable
personages of the middle and
latter half of the century. His
wide acquaintance with royalty
(some of them mad) would be
appalling if it were not mentioned
with winning modesty.
The volume abounds in good
stories, my Baronite particularly
delighting in one pertaining to the
ceremony of prorogation of parliament
by the <span class="sc">Queen</span>. Mr. <span class="sc">Lehmann</span>
was much struck with the
spectacle of the old Duke of <span class="sc">Wellington</span>
carrying the sword of
state, Lord <span class="sc">Lansdowne</span> bearing
the crown, and the Marquis of
<span class="sc">Winchester</span> with the cap of
maintenance set on red velvet
cushion. At Lady <span class="sc">Granville's</span>
the same evening he asked Lord
<span class="sc">Granville</span> what was the significance
of the cap of maintenance.
It was one of the few things
Lord <span class="sc">Granville</span> did not know.
"But," he said, "there is Lord
<span class="sc">Winchester</span>, who carried it this
morning. I will go and ask
him." The two peers conversed
in a whisper, and Lord <span class="sc">Granville</span>,
returning to his inquiring
friend, said, "He does not know
either." Mr. <span class="sc">Lehmann</span> incidentally
mentions that his brother
<span class="sc">Henry's</span> first success, at the Salon of 1835,
was gained by a picture setting forth "<em>Le
Départ du Jeune Tobie</em>." At that date
<span class="sc">Toby</span> had not even arrived to take his place
on the volumes in his master's study, and
still less, was he M.P. for Barks. It only
shows how prophetic is the soul of genius.</p>

<h2>NOTICES TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

<p><em>Perplexed.</em>&mdash;You are entirely in error in
supposing that the member for Otley, Yorks,
has, in accepting a baronetcy, descended
from a higher estate. You have been deceived
by similarity of sound. The hon. member
was not of the same rank as a statesman (who
we observe has just repaired to his country
seat at Pinley Park, where he will entertain
His Serene Highness the <span class="sc">Duc de Seidlitz-Poudre</span>)
to whom Sir <span class="sc">Robert Peel</span> used to
allude in the House of Commons as "the
noble Baron." In becoming Sir <span class="sc">John Barran</span>,
Bart., the member for Otley gains a distinct
step in the social ladder.</p>

<p><em>Blind, Deaf, and Dumb.</em>&mdash;We are pleased
to be able to reassure you. The fact that you
have not lately heard or read speeches by Sir
<span class="sc">William Harcourt</span> is no evidence that the
treble disability under which you unhappily
labour is increasing. There is a well known
case, cited in Littleton upon Coke, where a
man was not able to see the Spanish fleet
"because it is not yet in sight." For analogous
reason you have not lately heard anything
of the <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>.
He has not been speaking. The
fact is, the <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>&mdash;to use a
title by which he is locally known, and in
which he most rejoices&mdash;was cut out for a
rustic recluse. Circumstances have, unwillingly,
dragged him into the front of politics,
and he has done the duty that lies to his
hand. When opportunity can be made he
takes his leisure at his lodge in the New
Forest, and meditates on the untimely fate of
his pre-Plantagenet forbear <span class="sc">William Rufus</span>.
Nevertheless, we are not without suspicion
that Sir <span class="sc">William Harcourt</span> shares the peculiarity
of <span class="sc">Carlyle</span>, of whom you will remember
his wife shrewdly remarked that
"his love for silence is platonic." If you
keep your ears open and your mouth shut,
you may probably, before long, hear the
familiar voice resounding from a public
platform.</p>

<p><em>A Shakspearean Student.</em>&mdash;We had not
before heard of the incident. It is, however,
quite possible, as you have been informed,
that when the Marquis of <span class="sc">Salisbury</span>, K.G.,
heard of the defection of the Earl of <span class="sc">Buckinghamshire</span>,
who has joined the Liberal
forces, the only remark he made was "Off
with his head."</p>

<h2>OVERHEARD FRAGMENT OF A DIALOGUE</h2>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> My dear <span class="sc">Goring</span>, I assure you that a well-tied
tie is the first serious step in life.</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> My dear <span class="sc">Illingworth</span>, five well-made button-holes
a day are far more essential. They please women,
and women rule society.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/024a-200.png"><img src="images/024a-100.png" width="100" height="238" alt="'Full of good things!'" /></a>
<p>"Full of good things!"</p></div>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> I understood you considered
women of no importance?</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> My dear <span class="sc">George</span>, a man's life revolves
on curves of intellect. It is on the hard lines
of the emotions that a woman's life progresses. Both
revolve in cycles of masterpieces. They should revolve
on bi-cycles; built, if possible, for two. But
I am keeping you?</p>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> I wish you were. Nowadays it is
only the poor who are kept at the expense of the rich.</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> Yes. It is perfectly comic, the
number of young men going about the world nowadays
who adopt perfect profiles as a useful profession.</p>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> Surely that must be the next
world? How about the Chiltern Thousands?</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> Don't. <span class="sc">George</span>. Have you seen
<span class="sc">Windermere</span> lately? Dear <span class="sc">Windermere</span>! I should
like to be exactly unlike <span class="sc">Windermere</span>.</p>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> Poor <span class="sc">Windermere</span>! He spends his mornings
in doing what is possible, and his evenings in saying what is probable.
By the way, do you really understand all I say?</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> Yes, when I don't listen attentively.</p>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> Reach me the matches, like a good boy&mdash;thanks.
Now&mdash;define these cigarettes&mdash;as tobacco.</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> My dear <span class="sc">George</span>, they are atrocious. And they
leave me unsatisfied.</p>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> You are a promising disciple of mine. The
only use of a disciple is that at the moment of one's triumph he
stands behind one's chair and shouts that after all he is immortal.</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> You are quite right. It is as well, too, to remember
from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be learnt.</p>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> Certainly, and ugliness is the root of all industry.</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> <span class="sc">George</span>, your conversation is delightful, but your
views are terribly unsound. You are always saying insincere things.</p>

<p><em>Lord Illingworth.</em> If one tells the truth, one is sure sooner or later
to be found out.</p>

<p><em>Lord Goring.</em> Perhaps. The sky is like a hard hollow sapphire. It
is too late to sleep. I shall go down to Covent Garden and look at the
roses. Good-night, <span class="sc">George</span>! I have had such a pleasant evening!</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>

<h3>IX.&mdash;<span class="sc">Of Coal.</span></h3>

<p>The County Council has solved the great Mudford
mystery by deciding in favour of Mrs. <span class="sc">Arble
March</span>, who is in the seventh heaven at being
the Seventh Councillor. A wise Legislature had
it in contemplation that possibly when the great
measure came to be worked, it might not be found
to act, however much you pulled the string, and
it was accordingly left to the County Council to
set on its legs any poor little Parish Council which
might have been brought into the world without
its full number of members. Thus it came about
that Mrs. <span class="sc">March</span> got elected. The actual circumstances
of her election gave rise to some comment.
She was proposed by the Primrose League
Ruling Councillor of one adjoining parish, and
seconded by the Knight Harbinger of another.
Our County Council is a strongly Tory body, and
she was easily elected. There was a great outcry
against this, as an act of political partisanship. It
was. But when it became known that Mrs.
<span class="sc">Letham Havitt's</span> friends and supporters were all
avowed Radicals, popular indignation seemed
suddenly to flicker out.</p>

<p>It may be, however, that the indignation only
transferred itself to me, for I myself have got, in
a most extraordinary and unexpected fashion, into
a great hobble. It arose in this way. Having
been elected on to the Parish Council at the top
of the poll, and having, moreover, been subsequently
the recipient of innumerable congratulations
from my fellow-parishioners, I not unnaturally&mdash;so
I still venture to think&mdash;desired in
some way to show my appreciation of the kind
treatment I had received. I accordingly determined
to make to every elector a present of coals,
and to carry out that intention issued the following
circular:&mdash;</p>

<h4><em>To the Electors of Mudford.</em></h4>

<p><span class="sc">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;For your kindness
in electing me at the top of the poll, I can find no
terms sufficiently warm to express myself. In
commemoration of the great occasion, and as a
small thankoffering for my return, I beg your
acceptance of the enclosed Coal Ticket, which will
entitle you to 2 cwt. of coal from any of the village
coal dealers.</p>

<p class="author1">Your obliged and obedient servant,</p>
<p class="author"><span class="sc">Timothy Winkins</span>.</p>

<p>I sent this to every elector, high or low, rich or
poor. I hardly imagined that the Squire would
want coal, but he was a constituent of mine, and
he had his ticket. What has been the result of
my generosity? This. Whilst almost every coal-ticket
has been used, I am denounced right and
left in unmeasured terms as an unscrupulous
briber. Miss <span class="sc">Phill Burtt</span> (who, as might be
expected, has been most kind and sympathetic
about the whole thing), tells me that even the
Squire said it was a very ingenious way of wishing
myself Many Happy Returns to the Parish Council.
A poor joke, I think, but an undeniably excellent
sneer. <span class="sc">Black Bob</span> is, as might be expected,
much more plain and direct in his denunciation.
He says, that if I stand for re-election&mdash;in April,
1896!&mdash;this ought to be enough to unseat me. A
pleasant prospect. I can do nothing. My boats,
like my coal, are burnt.</p>

<p>What happened at the Parish Council meeting
last night I must leave&mdash;till my next.</p>
